## Architecture Overview

StayFinder follows a client-server architecture with a clear separation between the frontend and backend components. The application is built using modern web technologies and follows best practices for scalability, security, and maintainability.

## Key Components

### Frontend (Client)

The frontend is built with React and follows a component-based architecture:

-   **Framework**: React with Vite as the build tool
-   **Routing**: React Router for client-side routing
-   **State Management**:
    -   React Context for global state
    -   TanStack Query for server state management
    -   React Hook Form for form state
-   **UI Components**: Custom component library built with Tailwind CSS
-   **API Communication**: Axios for HTTP requests
-   **Maps**: Leaflet for interactive maps

### Backend (Server)

The backend is built with Node.js and Express and follows a modular architecture:

-   **Framework**: Express.js
-   **API Design**: RESTful API design
-   **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication
-   **Validation**: Joi for request validation
-   **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling middleware
-   **Logging**: Structured logging with different levels based on environment

### Database

The application uses MongoDB as its primary database:

-   **Database**: MongoDB
-   **ODM**: Mongoose for object modeling
-   **Schema Design**: Well-defined schemas with validation
-   **Indexing**: Appropriate indexes for performance optimization
-   **Geospatial Queries**: Support for location-based searches

### External Services

The application integrates with several external services:

-   **Image Storage**: Cloudinary for storing and serving images
-   **Email Service**: Nodemailer for sending transactional emails
-   **Geocoding**: External geocoding API for location data

## Data Flow

1. **User Interaction**: User interacts with the React frontend
2. **API Request**: Frontend makes HTTP requests to the backend API
3. **Authentication**: Backend authenticates the request using JWT
4. **Validation**: Backend validates the request data
5. **Business Logic**: Backend processes the request and performs business logic
6. **Database Operation**: Backend interacts with the MongoDB database
7. **External Service**: Backend may interact with external services (e.g., Cloudinary)
8. **Response**: Backend sends a response back to the frontend
9. **State Update**: Frontend updates its state based on the response
10. **UI Update**: Frontend re-renders the UI to reflect the new state

## Security Measures

-   **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with secure token handling
-   **Authorization**: Role-based access control for different user types
-   **Input Validation**: Thorough validation of all user inputs
-   **HTTPS**: All communication over HTTPS
-   **CORS**: Proper CORS configuration to prevent unauthorized access
-   **Helmet**: Security headers to protect against common web vulnerabilities
-   **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force attacks
-   **Password Hashing**: Secure password storage using bcrypt

## Scalability Considerations

-   **Stateless Backend**: The backend is designed to be stateless, allowing for horizontal scaling
-   **Database Indexing**: Proper indexing for efficient queries
-   **Caching**: Implementation of caching strategies for frequently accessed data
-   **Pagination**: All list endpoints support pagination to limit resource usage
-   **Compression**: Response compression to reduce bandwidth usage
-   **Lazy Loading**: Frontend implements lazy loading for code splitting

## Deployment Architecture

The application can be deployed in various environments:

### Development Environment

-   Local development setup with hot reloading
-   Local MongoDB instance
-   Mock external services when needed

### Staging Environment

-   Deployed on a staging server
-   Separate MongoDB instance for staging
-   Integration with test instances of external services

### Production Environment

-   Deployed on production servers with load balancing
-   Production MongoDB instance with proper backup and monitoring
-   Integration with production instances of external services
-   CDN for static assets
-   Monitoring and logging infrastructure

## Monitoring and Logging

-   **Error Tracking**: Centralized error tracking and reporting
-   **Performance Monitoring**: Monitoring of API response times and resource usage
-   **Logging**: Structured logging with different levels based on environment
-   **Alerts**: Alerts for critical errors and performance issues

## Future Architectural Considerations

-   **Microservices**: Potential migration to a microservices architecture for specific features
-   **Serverless**: Exploration of serverless architecture for specific functions
-   **Real-time Features**: Implementation of WebSockets for real-time features
-   **Mobile App**: Development of native mobile applications
-   **Analytics**: Integration with analytics platforms for user behavior tracking
